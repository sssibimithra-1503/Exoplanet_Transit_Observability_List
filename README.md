# Exoplanet_Transit_Observability_List
This code will list the available transit observable from JCBT for a given night and plot

Dependencies: Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Astropy, Astroplan, pytz

Transit_CSV:

This code will find the rise, set, transit time of the given list of objects then finds the objects which has transits on the given night obserrvable from JCBT.

In the execution we have to define the path of input csv file catalog, date of observation and output filename

transit_plot:

This code will plot the rise, set and transit time of the given exoplanet on a given date

In the execution we have to define the path of input csv file catalog, name of the exoplanet, date of observation.
